# Vote App - Built with React Native, Firebase, and GraphQL (Hasura)

This project is a survey application built using React Native, Firebase, and GraphQL with Hasura. Users can log in via Firebase, create new surveys, and participate in surveys created by other users. Real-time database updates, a GraphQL-powered API, and user interactions provide a dynamic survey experience.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication:** Users can securely log in with Firebase.
- **Survey Creation:** Users can create their own surveys and add questions.
- **Participate in Surveys:** Users can participate in surveys created by others and view results.
- **Real-time Database:** Survey results are updated in real time using Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database.
- **GraphQL API:** The backend is powered by Hasura, which automatically generates a powerful GraphQL API for managing survey data.
- **User Profiles:** Profile features are available for logged-in users.
- **Survey Types:** Supports multiple question types such as multiple choice, short answer, and rating.
